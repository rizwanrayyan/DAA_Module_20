# EX 2B BACKTRACKING - NQUEEN PROBLEM
## DATE: 29-10-2025
## AIM:
To solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking, which places N queens on an N*N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.


## Algorithm
1. Read the value of N and create an N x N chessboard initialized with 0s.
2. Define a function isSafe() to check if a queen can be placed at a given position by ensuring no other queens threaten it horizontally, and diagonally (upper-left and lower-left).
3. Use a recursive function solveNQUtil() that tries to place queens column by column.
4. If a safe position is found, place the queen and recursively try to place the rest; if it fails, backtrack and remove the queen.
5. Print the board if a solution is found; otherwise, print "Solution does not exist".

            if solveNQUtil(board, col + 1):
                return True
            board[i][col] = 0

    return False

def solveNQ():
    board = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    
    if not solveNQUtil(board, 0):
        print("Solution does not exist")
        return False

    printSolution(board)
    return True

## Output:

## Result:
The N-Queens program executed successfully, and a valid board configuration was generated.
